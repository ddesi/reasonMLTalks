### [Reason Syntax and Toolchain For OCaml](https://pusher.com/sessions/meetup/reasonldn/reason-syntax-and-toolchain-for-ocaml) - [@marcelcutts](https://github.com/marcelcutts) speaking at ReasonLDN, June 2017.
A rocket fuelled tour on the origin, purpose and utility of ReasonML. Weâ€™ll touch on everything from how a keyboard company is guilty of putting OCaml in your browser, and answer the critical question of why surfing this hype wave is excellent for your hipster cred.

### [A Pragmatist's Guide to ReasonML](https://pusher.com/sessions/meetup/reactivate-london/a-pragmatists-guide-to-reasonmla) - [@marcelcutts](https://github.com/marcelcutts) speaking at Reactivate London, April 2017.
  What is ReasonML, and why does it seem to keep dripping into our React ecosystem? Is this just one of those crazy hipster things? Should I learn it now, later, or never at all? These questions and more will be answered in this talk.
